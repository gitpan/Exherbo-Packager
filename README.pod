=head1 Exherbo::Packager

=head2 Synopsis

Generate Exheres automatically for Perl modules

=head2 Things to consider

You ought to check the output exheres and tweak a few things. This module
is rather dumb in its current state.

=over 

=item Dependencies might include packages that don't exist

=item Deps might not have sensible versions

=item Deps might not be sensible

=item You might've picked up a fake package

=back

I plan on fixing these particular issues, and embellishing the code. However,
that's not going to happen right this second, since I want to package some
things right now.

=head2 BUGS

Everything listed above is a huge bug. Also, it would be nice if there were
Perl hooks in Paludis so I could check the existence of packages
